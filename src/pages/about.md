> Hi, I’m Sakthy.

I mess around with code, engineering and psychology making weird little things like Freudian quizzes, typing behavior experiments, and whatever else my brain fixates on that week. This blog is where I throw all that stuff: half-baked ideas, strange prototypes, and things I’ll probably regret building later.

I’m not a psychologist. I’m just curious (and easily obsessed).

This is my quiet corner of the web. Sometimes it’s messy. Sometimes it’s overthought. Mostly, it’s fun.

I write these blog “articles” for myself because I forget everything if I don’t. But hey if you stumble across something useful (or just weirdly interesting), I’m glad you did.

Feel free to reach out if you ever want to chat. I kinda built this hoping someone would. 😂
